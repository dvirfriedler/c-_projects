This project is DamkeGame through the Console.
The game is against a friend, or the computer.
Before the game start the user decides the size of the board, and against how to play.
	 
I implemented this project in C# using the concepts of OOP  while keeping a high level of coding style.
	 
The project builds such that the Interface and the Logic  are separate, such that i can take the "logic" of the project and use it with another interface.

In addition to  the project, there is a pdf file that  presnt a diagram of the connection between the different objects in the project.

Use "DamkeGame.sln" to run the program.
