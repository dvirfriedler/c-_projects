This project is Checkers Windows application.
The user play against a friend, or the computer.
	 
I implemented this project in C# using the concepts of OOP  while keeping a high level of coding style.
The code logic are the same logic of the DamkaGame consul-app(You can see this project on the c# directory)
	 
The project builds such that the UI and the Logic are separate.

Use "Checkers(Windows-app).sln" to run the program.
