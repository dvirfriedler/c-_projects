This project is meant to help "Gragae" manage the different vehicles that he supposes
to serve.

I implemented this project in C#  using the concepts of OOP and polymorphism while
keeping a high level of coding style.

The project builds such that the Interface and the Logic of the project are
separate.

Moreover, the project structure enables to add of new types of vehicles while making
a very small change in the interface and no changes in the logic!


In addition to  the project, there is a pdf file that  presents a diagram
of the connection between the different objects in the project.

Use "Gargage.sln" to run the project.
